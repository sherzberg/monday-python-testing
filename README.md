Python Testing
==============

This project will be used in my companies Monday Night Tech Talks. We will be covering a variety of testing frameworks and tools in Python.

Each subfolder will have examples and tutorials in differnt frameworks and tools. Move to each folder to view the README and run the example files.

Setup

You only need vagrant and virtualbox setup. We will be running all of the examples and tutorials from inside the vagrant instance:

```bash
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
$ lsb_release -a
```
